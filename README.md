# Funding Page - Frontend Test v1.1

##You're a frontend developer for a new MedicTrust project.

Our CEO wants a new funding page. The project manager hands you some notes from the Project Planning Meeting where the details of the page were (sort of) ironed out. When you look at the notes you think (quietly, to yourself, of course):

**You:**
> Hm, this specification is more than a little vague and weird in spots.

The notes read:

  1. (25 points) Create a page like a image using html and css.
  2. (10 points) Top up text at progress bar.
  3. (35 points) "Save to later" button action using javascript (Redirect/Move to Save page).
  4. (35 points) "Tell your friends" button action using javascript (Modal box or whatever you want).
  5. (50 points) More attractive.
